# ford_used_cars_analysis

This repository contains a csv file of the dataset used for the analysis and a Jupyter Notebook of data visualization code of correlation analysis and distribution of observations in the dataset. The dataset contains 17964 observations (rows) and 8 variables (columns). 

The variables of the dataset are: 
  1. **model** - model of the car
  2. **year** - year of manufacture
  3. **price** - price of the car
  4. **transmission** - type of transmission in the car (Automatic, Manual and Semi-automatic)
  5. **mileage** - mileage of the car

  7. **mpg** - miles the car run per gallon
  8. **engineSize** - size of the engine used in the car

In this project, the dataset has been visualised to find correlations between various factors and distribution using barplot, scatter plot, regression plot, distribution plot, ECDF and boxplot.
