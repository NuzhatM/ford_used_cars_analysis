# ford_used_cars_analysis

This repository contains a csv file of the dataset used for the analysis and a Jupyter Notebook of data visualization code of correlation analysis and distribution of observations in the dataset. The dataset contains 17964 observations (rows) and 8 attributes (columns). 

The attributes of the dataset are: 
  1. **model** - model of the car
  2. **year** - year of manufacture
  3. **price** - price of the car
  4. **transmission** - type of transmission in the car (Automatic, Manual and Semi-automatic)
  5. **mileage** - mileage of the car
  6. **fuelType** - type of fuel used in the car (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid and Others)
  7. **mpg** - miles the car run per gallon
  8. **engineSize** - size of the engine used in the car

**Data processing and cleaning:**
1. Importing necessary python packages
2. Reading the excel (.csv) file
3. Naming the new dataFrame
4. Finding the number of rows and columns
5. Descriptive Statistics of the dataset
6. Finding the data types and missing values

**Data Analysis Objectives** 
1. Visualising the dataset using barplots
2. What are the top 5 selling car models in the dataset?
3. What's the average selling price of the top 5 selling car models?
4. What's the total sale of the top 5 selling car models?

**Data Visualisation**
In this project, the dataset has been visualised to find correlations between various factors, and distribution using barplot, scatter plot, regression plot, distribution plot, ECDF and boxplot.
